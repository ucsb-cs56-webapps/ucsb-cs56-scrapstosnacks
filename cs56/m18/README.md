Hello everyone!
We created this application simply as a site that allows college kids like us to find recipes to cook with whatever is left in your fridge or pantry! We hope you can expand and improve on it.

BUGS: when you input only one or two ingredients, it will simply take the data as an empty string. It would be good to handle the case when you put in less ingredients than the capacity ingredients.

When inputting the ingredients, you have to use a specific format, it also would be good to fix this to allow any format. 

Our code is definitely need of some refactoring. The first thing needed is probably restructuring it so that it is open for extension and closed for modification.

Things we wanted to add: In the database, we wanted to add a section for instructions per recipe as well as some photos! Eventually, also adding approximate amount of time it takes to cook the recipe would be awesome.

Thanks,
Have fun!
